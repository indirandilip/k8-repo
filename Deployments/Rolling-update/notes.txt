Managing Application lifecycle:
------------------------------
Deployment:

- recreate   ----- Takes down all old Pods before starting new ones. Results in downtime. 
- update     ----- Updates Pods gradually, replacing them one by one. Ensures zero downtime.
- rollout    ----- pause, resume, undo the changes. 
- versioning ----- images changes, version.
